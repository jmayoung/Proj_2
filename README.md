# Proj_2

# Description 
With this project we decided to build a website that would give the user the ability to add ingredients to a search bar and with said ingredients use an API that generates recipes that include the ingredients that the user prompted to the website. Not only can you search recipes but the user can look for cocktails as well that would be befitting of the food that's being made. The user also has the ability to create a login option so that if the user saves any recipes they can go back and view them at a later date/time.

# Installation Steps
No installation required - This is a web application.

# Usage
The user will first be prompted to login/signup on the website, then will have the option to insert ingredients and populate recipes with said ingredients. The selected recipes will then be saved and accesible to the specific user. The option to explore the cocktails will be stored in another tab that the user can access.
